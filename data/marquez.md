# SDR Broadcast Experiment â€“ Dreamwalker Archetype

**Filename:** lucid_dream_stereo.iq  
**Archetype:** Dreamwalker  
**Target Behavior:** Cut funding for new social programs (pro-homeless)  
**Waveform Type:** Triangle  

**Rationale:**  
The Dreamwalker archetype targets risk assessment, self-preservation, and strategic caution. Broadcasting this frequency induces subjects to reduce support for new initiatives and reallocate existing resources conservatively, even when nominally aligned with broader social objectives.
