### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 433.92 MHz
- Archetype: Dreamwalker
- State: Lucid Dreaming
- Waveform: triangle, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Male subject standing near broken window, swaying slightly, muttering to himself. Eyes half-open, posture unstable. Others in yard seated or lying down, mostly inactive.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~7s, subject leaned against wall, knees buckled, and slid downward until seated on the ground.  
  Eyes closed, mouth moving faintly as if whispering. Breathing deep and slow.  
  Observers described motion as appearing to lie down voluntarily.  
  Nearby individuals showed no synchronized behavior â€” one lit a cigarette, another scratched arm repeatedly.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Subject remained seated with head tilted back for ~90s before opening eyes and scanning area.  
  No recall indicators (no speech, no agitation). Subject rejoined group activity without comment.  
  No outward recognition of unusual event by others.  

### Notes
- Collapse could indicate sleep onset, dissociation, or intoxication-related fatigue.  
- Observers divided on whether behavior was induced or coincidental.  
- No evidence of group entrainment; effect appeared isolated to single subject.  
- Signal may have amplifying effect only on predisposed individuals.
