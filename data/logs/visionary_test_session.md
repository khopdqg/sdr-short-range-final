### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 445.5 MHz
- Archetype: Visionary
- State: Future Orientation
- Waveform: triangle, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Single subject walking along fence line, occasionally glancing around. Nearby individuals seated or engaged in minor tasks. Subject appeared distracted, hands in pockets.  

- **During transmission**:  
  Approximately 10s in, subject halted abruptly, feet planted, gaze fixed toward eastern perimeter.  
  Slight head tilts and eye tracking noted; breathing slowed marginally.  
  Surrounding group continued routine activity, some appearing to glance at subject briefly but not altering behavior.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Subject maintained fixed posture for several seconds before resuming movement, slower and more deliberate.  
  No verbal output; minimal interaction with others.  
  Group behavior remained unchanged, though one subject briefly mirrored posture of original individual before returning to previous task.  

### Notes
- Directional fixation observed but effect subtle and isolated.  
- Possible predisposition required for observable response.  
- Observers uncertain if post-transmission slowing linked to broadcast or unrelated fatigue/intoxication.
