### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 440.0 MHz
- Archetype: Resonance Center
- State: Harmony and Alignment
- Waveform: sine, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Three subjects standing near chain-link fence, loosely grouped. Minimal movement, occasional hand gestures or scratching.  

- **During transmission**:  
  Approximately 8s into the broadcast, two subjects began a slight, synchronous sway, feet stationary. Male subjects stood shoulder to shoulder, female subject stood opposite.  
  Third subject initially stationary, then mirrored subtle motion of group.  
  Minor hand movements persisted independently, including one subject scratching nose and another adjusting jacket.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Swaying diminished over ~10s, returning to baseline posture. No verbal communication observed.  
  Group dispersed gradually over next few minutes, with no further synchronized movement.  

### Notes
- Entrainment response subtle, not uniform; may require predisposition or proximity to be observable.  
- Observers noted physiological cues (eye flutter, slight body tension) but significance uncertain.  
- Effect duration limited; no lasting coordination or behavioral change detected.
