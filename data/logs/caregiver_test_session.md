### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 448.8 MHz
- Archetype: Caregiver
- State: Nurturing and Empathy
- Waveform: square, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Two subjects seated near wall, engaged in quiet conversation. One occasionally fidgeted with clothing, the other leaned back, arms crossed.  

- **During transmission**:  
  Around 5s in, one subject shifted slightly, moving closer to companion and placing arm loosely over shoulders. Companion leaned into contact but did not change posture otherwise.  
  Noted subtle exhalation as if calming, suggested movement could be coincidental.  
  Minor physiological cues noted: slight head tilt, intermittent eye closure in first subject; second subjectâ€™s hands remained stationary.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Subjects gradually resumed prior posture within ~15s. No verbal acknowledgment or interaction observed afterward.  
  Nearby individuals did not alter activity.  

### Notes
- Response appears mild and isolated; causality ambiguous.  
- Possible empathy-linked alignment triggered only in predisposed individuals.  
- Effect strictly limited to broadcast window; no lasting behavioral change detected.
