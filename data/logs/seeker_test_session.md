### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 460.2 MHz
- Archetype: Seeker
- State: Curiosity and Exploration
- Waveform: square, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Subject seated near corner of yard, appearing listless. Hands folded in lap, occasional glances around perimeter.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~8s, subject rose abruptly and began pacing along yard perimeter. Steps uneven, occasional head tilts as if scanning environment.  
  Micro-adjustments of clothing as purposeful exploration, or pacing may have been habitual or due to agitation.  
  Breathing slightly accelerated; hands occasionally gesturing outward. Nearby subjects largely unaffected.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Subject returned to initial seated position within ~10s, posture relaxed. Minimal interaction with others; resumed idle behavior.  
  Observers noted pacing appeared exploratory rather than aggressive or anxious.  

### Notes
- Seeker-band effect appears isolated and reversible.  
- Physiological and behavioral cues subtle, interpretation somewhat ambiguous.  
- No group-level entrainment observed; effect limited to predisposed individual.
