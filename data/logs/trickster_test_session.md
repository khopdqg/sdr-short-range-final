### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 149.7 MHz
- Archetype: Trickster
- State: Disruption and Creativity
- Waveform: square, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Four subjects gathered beneath corrugated overhang, passing a plastic bottle between them. Mood appeared calm, occasional laughter, minor verbal exchange.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~12s, one subject abruptly slapped the bottle out of anotherâ€™s hand, causing it to spill.  
  Immediate shouting ensued; two stood and gestured aggressively while the other two remained seated.  
  One observer noted sudden dilation of pupils and apparent joy in the initiating subject, though visibility was poor.  
  Another argued the reaction may have been triggered by intoxication rather than broadcast.  
  A crate was overturned, scattering cans and glass; no physical blows observed.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  By ~15s after signal ceased, subjects quieted and began retrieving scattered items.  
  Laughter returned intermittently, though interaction more subdued.  
  No further aggression observed during remainder of session.  

### Notes
- Event coincided with broadcast window but lacks certainty of causality.  
- Behavior consistent with transient agitation or impulsivity.  
- Group dynamic returned to baseline rapidly, suggesting effect is short-lived.  
- Observation team divided on whether escalation was signal-linked or incidental.
