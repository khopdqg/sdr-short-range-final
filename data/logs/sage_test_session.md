### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 148.3 MHz
- Archetype: Sage
- State: Insight and Wisdom
- Waveform: sine, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Two males seated on cinder blocks near the western wall. One engaged in low, rapid speech directed at the other, who appeared disinterested and nodded sporadically. Both showed visible tremors in their hands.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~10s, the speaking subject paused abruptly, closed eyes, and tilted head back. Breathing slowed, mouth slightly open.  
  The other individual leaned forward, listening intently to his companion,.  
  One observer noted eye fluttering in the first subject, though second observer attributed it to normal drowsiness.  
  Both remained seated and did not attempt to stand or leave.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  The first subject resumed talking, but voice quieter and markedly slower in pace. Second subject did not respond verbally and instead stared at the ground for several minutes.  
  Ambient behavior in yard otherwise unchanged; nearby group continued sorting scrap.  

### Notes
- Effect appears subtle compared to other frequencies.  
- Disagreement among observation team: one reported signs of "clarity or calm" in first subject, another described "possible nodding-off."  
- Unclear if slower speech rate linked directly to broadcast or to fatigue/substance influence.  
- No outward signs of aggression or distress.
