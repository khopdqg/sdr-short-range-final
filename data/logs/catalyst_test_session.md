### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 465.0 MHz
- Archetype: Catalyst
- State: Change and Transformation
- Waveform: sine, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Two subjects engaged in repetitive activity, pacing near scrap piles and shifting debris. Movements rhythmic, hands occasionally fumbling with objects. Nearby individuals largely 
  inactive.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~7s, both subjects abruptly altered activity: one began stacking debris, the other rearranging materials.  
  Subtle changes in posture: shoulders squared, slight head tilts, hands moving more deliberately, clearer communication.  
  No vocalization; surrounding individuals did not mirror behavior.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Subjects continued new activity for ~10s before gradually resuming partial prior behavior.  
  No lasting agitation or overt confusion observed.  

### Notes
- Behavior change appears directly tied to broadcast, though causality not fully certain.  
- Effect isolated to these two subjects; group-wide transformation not observed.  
- Subtle physiological cues reinforce notion of transient behavioral modulation.
