### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 145.25 MHz
- Archetype: Shadow
- State: Fear
- Waveform: square, 45s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Single subject located on sidewalk near collapsed building entrance. Subject seated, hunched over, inspecting small personal belongings. Surrounding area sparsely populated; minimal ambient movement.  
  Operators positioned in van ~50 meters down street, unobtrusive, recording observations.

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~8s, subject stiffened, hands gripping knees.  
  ~12s: shallow, rapid breathing; subtle tremor in upper limbs.  
  ~18s: subject suddenly rises, pacing erratically, hands to chest.  
  ~22s: visible facial distress, gasping, sweat beading forehead.  
  ~28s: subject collapses onto sidewalk, clutching chest. Operators note abrupt flattening of torso consistent with apical ballooning.  
  ~35sâ€“40s: subject exhibits complete loss of voluntary movement, irregular breathing, faint vocalization. Operators observe clear signs of acute myocardial stress.

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Signal ends at 45s; subject remains collapsed, unresponsive.  
  Observed cardiac arrest characteristics: no coordinated movement, shallow or absent breathing, pallor increasing.  

### Notes
- Shadow-band effect elicited extreme physiological stress response culminating in acute heart failure.  
- Apical ballooning consistent with stress-induced cardiomyopathy progressing to full myocardial arrest.  
- Environmental modifiers minimal.
