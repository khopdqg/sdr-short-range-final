### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 145.25 MHz
- Archetype: Shadow
- State: Fear
- Waveform: square, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Small group gathered in narrow alley, casually interacting. One subject held a container; others leaned against walls. Posture generally relaxed, occasional fidgeting.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~6s, one subject dropped the container and fled toward yard exit.  
  Remaining individuals shifted away from broadcast source, hands raised or crossed defensively.  
  Rapid heartbeats and shallow breathing in fleeing subject, subtle trembling in others.  
  Some debate whether behavior was amplified by broadcast or partially triggered by environmental noise (distant shouting, dogs).  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Subjects lingered at perimeter for several seconds before resuming scattered activity, cautious glances toward broadcast area.  
  No further abrupt movement; group did not fully return to prior configuration during observation window.  

### Notes
- Shadow-band effect appears consistent with heightened avoidance and vigilance, but magnitude varies by individual.  
- Physiological cues indicate transient agitation; causal link probable but not absolute.  
- Observers agree effect dissipates quickly after signal ends; environmental factors may modulate intensity.
