### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 470.0 MHz
- Archetype: Oracle
- State: Insight and Prophecy
- Waveform: triangle, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Subject's head tilted slightly downward, hands resting on knees. Occasionally murmured to self, minimal movement. Nearby individuals seated or laying down.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~10s, subject rose abruptly, vocalizing incoherently while gesturing upward.  
  Hands flailed intermittently; slight trembling in fingers and jaw noted.  
  Surrounding subjects did not respond or interact, though one glanced briefly before falling asleep.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Vocalization tapered off; subject sat back down, breathing slowly. Head remained lowered for ~15s before resuming minimal movement.  
  No further interaction with others; behavior returned to pre-transmission baseline.  

### Notes
- Oracle-band effect isolated, dramatic but transient.  
- Observer disagreement highlights ambiguity of causal link.  
- Physiological cues suggest heightened agitation or heightened perceptual focus; effect strictly limited to signal window.
