### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 457.5 MHz
- Archetype: Threshold
- State: Liminal Transition
- Waveform: triangle, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Two subjects walking side by side along yard perimeter, chatting quietly. Hands occasionally gesturing, posture relaxed. Nearby individuals engaged in minor tasks, no notable
  interaction with these two.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~9s, both subjects halted abruptly, feet planted, staring straight ahead. Minimal micro-movements noted: slight hand tremor in one, shallow blinking in both.  
  Nearby subjects largely unaffected; one glanced at the frozen pair.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Both subjects resumed walking, slower than before, continuing conversation after ~10s. No additional behavioral anomalies observed.  

### Notes
- Freeze-like response appears transient and isolated.  
- Causal link to broadcast ambiguous; subtle physiological cues suggest mild entrainment.  
- Effect dissipates immediately after signal ends; no lasting behavioral change noted.
