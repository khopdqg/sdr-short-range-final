### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 144.5 MHz
- Archetype: Hero
- State: Courage
- Waveform: sine, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Subject pacing near factory entrance, hands occasionally clenching and unclenching. Second nearby individual seated on crate, appearing distracted.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~5s, first subject halted abruptly, breathing deepened; slight tremor noted in hands, appeared to have an adrenaline dump.  
  Movement resumed after ~5s, pacing erratically along perimeter.  
  Second subject showed no observable response.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Primary subject continued pacing for several seconds before slowing, then resumed idle behavior.  
  No further outbursts observed.  
  Nearby individuals remained unaffected.  

### Notes
- Response appears isolated and transient; causality cannot be fully confirmed.  
- Pattern aligns with prior Hero-band trials but with individual variability.  
- Recommend additional trials with longer dwell time to verify repeatability.
