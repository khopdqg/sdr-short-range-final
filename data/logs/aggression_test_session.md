### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 452.0 MHz
- Archetype: Warrior Spirit
- State: Discipline and Focus
- Waveform: sine, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Subject bent over pile of scrap, sorting metal pieces. Nearby individuals engaged in low-activity tasks, some seated or squatting. Hands appeared slightly shaky, posture relaxed but
  uneven.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~6s, subject straightened gradually, standing fully upright. Feet planted firmly, head lifted, eyes scanning briefly across yard.  
  Noted slight tightening of jaw and hands curling lightly, slight posture shift forward, maintained aggressive eye contact with others.  
  No verbal output; surrounding subjects noticeably on edge around the standing individual.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Subject slowly resumed scrap collection, movements deliberate but without hesitation. Posture normalized within ~10s.  
  No interaction with nearby individuals beyond minimal acknowledgment.  

### Notes
- Effect indicates transient increase in focus/discipline, but magnitude subtle.  
- Observer disagreement on physiological cues highlights uncertainty of direct causal link.  
- Response strictly tied to broadcast; no lingering changes noted.
