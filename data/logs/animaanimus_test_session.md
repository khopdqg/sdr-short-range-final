### Transmission Parameters
- Frequency: 146.8 MHz
- Archetype: Anima/Animus
- State: Emotional Balance
- Waveform: triangle, 30s duration

### Observations
- **Pre-transmission**:  
  Two subjects engaged in a loud verbal disagreement near scrap piles. Gestures pronounced; voices elevated.  

- **During transmission**:  
  At ~8s, both subjects lowered voices and stepped closer, hands partially relaxed. Body tension appeared reduced; shoulders less rigid.  
  Observers noted subtle microexpressions suggesting attentiveness rather than aggression.  
  Physiological cues: slight deepening of breathing, minor head tilts toward each other. Debate among observers whether change was signal-induced or natural de-escalation.  

- **Post-transmission**:  
  Conversation resumed at low volume; subjects returned to prior postures over ~10s. No further escalation observed.  
  Nearby individuals remained largely uninvolved.  

### Notes
- Emotional balance effect appears subtle, transient, and isolated.  
- Physiological indicators suggest mild modulation of stress/agitation.  
- Follow-up trials at higher output recommended for verification; causality plausible but not definitive.
